Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) class repository! This repository contains all the materials, notes, and assignments related to the OOPs course.

## Folder Structure

1. **Notes**: This folder contains all the lecture notes, presentations, and study materials for the OOPs course.

2. **Assignments**: This folder contains the assignments for the course.

    - **Assignment_x**: Each assignment is organized into its own subfolder, named `Assignment_x`, where `x` is the assignment number.
