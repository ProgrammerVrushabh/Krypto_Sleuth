You can decrypt the message using the provided code by applying a negative shift value corresponding to the encryption key. For instance, in this case, the key is 21, so for decryption, you'd use a shift value of -21. This code serves for both encryption and decryption purposes, with positive values for encryption and negative values for decryption.
